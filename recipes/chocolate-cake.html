        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start cake: Place cocoa in a medium bowl. Gently pour boiling water over top and<br>
                stir to combine; let cool, about 15 minutes.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour<br>
                three 9-inch round cake pans.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>Sift together flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder into a mixing bowl.</li>
            
            <br>

            <li> 
                Combine sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer until <br>
                creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. <br>
                Add flour mixture alternately with the cooled cocoa mixture, mixing only until <br>
                combined. Pour 1/3 of the cake batter into each of the prepared pans, spreading <br>evenly.
            </li>

            <br>
                
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean<br>
                and cakes pull away from the sides of the pans, 18 to 22 minutes. Remove cakes from the<br>
                oven and set on a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the <br>
                edges to loosen. Invert cakes carefully onto the wire rack and let cool completely, about<br>
                20 more minutes.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                While the cakes are cooling, make frosting and filling: Beat butter for frosting in a <br>
                mixing bowl until creamy. Gradually mix in confectioners' sugar, cocoa, and vanilla; <br>
                continue to mix until light and fluffy, 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Make filling: Whip heavy cream and vanilla in a bowl until cream becomes thick. Add <br>
                confectioners' sugar and continue to whip until stiff but not too grainy.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>Fill and frost cake: Remove cooled cake layers from pans. Trim any top surfaces to <br>
                make them flat. Place one layer on a nice plate and spread 1/3 of the filling over <br>
                the top. Top with another layer and another 1/2 of the remaining filling. Place the <br>
                remaining cake layer on top. Spread frosting around the sides of the layers, leaving <br>
                a ridge that extends up over the top edge. Spread the remaining filling over the top <br>
                of the cake, inside the ridge of frosting.
            </li>
